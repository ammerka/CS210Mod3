# CS210Mod3
This is my project from Module 3. It displays the accurate time for the time zone you are in and are able to add and hour, minute or second to the time. 
I really enjoyed this project because I was determined to add the actual time zone into the program, even though it was not required. I believe I did a really good job with going above and beyond on the logistical requirements necessary for this project. I could have, and continue to need to, improve on my comments/notations in a program. I tend to get so focused on what I need to do, I don't think of how it can be confusing for anyone that tries to go through my prgram after me. Finding out how to add local time, and where to put it in the code was definitely the hardest part. I used stackoverflow to assist me ( https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43493794/how-to-get-local-time-c) and also a lot of trial and error. The community in stack overflow is a really great resource to use. I think the the way I separated/ organized all the variables/classes, and brought it all back together on main, is going to helpful as I tackle bigger and bigger projects.
